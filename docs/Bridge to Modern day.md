The Modem and the BSS played a large role in getting the internet to where it is today, but there seems to be one gap that has to be bridged from the creation of the World Wide Web to the modern internet we have today; the search engine. Each of these BSSs were completelty isolated from another and you could only access if you knew exactly where to go. It seems like the search engine is really what takes the internet from being a collection of online resources into one choesive unit that can be navigated with ease.
