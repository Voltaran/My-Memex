### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article discusses issues relating to generative AI, plagiarism, and copywrite. The article brings up how new strides in Generative AI like ChatGPT or Mirdjourney have begun to raise the Ire of creators die to their work being used to train AI without their permission. When these AI models are being used to generate income and an artist or authors work is being used to train said AI, many believe that is an infringement of intellectual property laws. This is a very interesting debate that has many different viewpoints. One argument is that if a person were to go online and look at these articles or images, in a similar way they could train themselves to produce similar content to the AI and that wouldn’t be considered plagiarism. New artist don’t owe any of their earnings to their predecessors. However, this claim can be argued against simply by the fact that programs like these utilizes data scraping for the training of their AIs and most terms and conditions on standard websites will contain clauses that prohibit this action. Ultimately, this decision is still being made and the results of pending lawsuits will determine the future of what AI is allowed to use on the internet.
