My goal for this course was to learn about the early internet and the cultures within it that lead to the modern day. I think that there is a particular journey within my memex that outlines exactly that and it was very interesting to see how one thing lead to the next as I added notes to the Memex.

Starting with [[@driscollBirthModemWorld2022]]

This article discusses some of the earliest internet communities known as Bulletin Board systems, and how the birth of the modem allowed for regular people to start connecting with others via the internet, which was something that was largely in the hands of scientists before this point. I think its extremely interesting how this technology was quickly adopted by and same to be really associated with the teenagers of the time. Its so famillair to today, but I guess it is just a pattern that youth are some of the quickest to adopt changing technology and this was no different.

A really good account of the experience of youth utilizing this technology is in [[@MySecretlife]]

This article followed the experiences of a youth entering the BBS community and his adventures setting up his own community and socializing with people from across the country. One of the things that stuck out to me most is in a linked note that doesn’t appear on this journey [[Similarity to discord]]  in which I remarked that these early communities have a striking resemblance to modern discord servers in which there are moderators, themes, games, discussion on shared hobbies and all hosts of drama that come from interacting in niche online spaces. This really highlights how much inspiration modern online spaces took from their originators.

[[BBS and Dark Web]]

This note acts as a bridge from the past to the present.

This note remarks on the similarity between niche dark web communities and early BBSs. Hard to access communities where only a limited number of people can be logged in at once. The last note discussed the ways in which the present pulled the from the form of the past for cultural reasons or that online communities generally take a certain shape and that is reflected in the similarities. Here it is interesting how Dark web communities almost need to regress to past forms of online communities to maintain a level of privacy that cannot be obtained in the new structure of the internet. BBSs did originally take the fall for cybercrimes, perhaps the fact that Dark Web communities seem to follow a similar structure indicates that those who were worries about the danger of such communities back when BBSs were prevalent weren’t too far off the mark.

To finish off this journey and bridge from the past culture of the internet to its future we look at [[@ArtificialIntelligenceHelping]]

This article discusses how emerging technologies are being used to reduce cybercrime and track people over the internet. It really highlights how much has changed from the days when a young boy could appear as an older man to be respected in online spaces to where now an AI can analyze the way you type or interact on the internet to create a profile that can be linked to your real identity.
