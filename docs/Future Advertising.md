This article mentions how advertising may change in the future to be more subtle as the push of marketing turns into a pull. We could expect to be subtly influenced by quickly seeing an image of a watch on your wrist or a fancy carpet in your living room. Is this form of advertising preferred to what we have no? It would certainly be more intrusive, but less obtrusive. We are already subjecting ourselves to the influence of brands and the market, if the marketing becomes less in-your-face and instead becomes barely noticeable but more effective, is that a loss or a gain as we no longer have to deal with annoyance of 
advertisements?
