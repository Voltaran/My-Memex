The lectuturer discusses that the form of the internet is largely dependant on the fact that it was develped during the cold war and was used as a tool for simulated war in the early days of its develpment. Would this technology have existed in a time of peace? Would our culture of video games, simulaitons, competition, and violence still exist? These apsects are fundamental to idea of gaming but we do not question this because it has always been this way. What would it look like if these were not the foundation of gaming aand computer culture?
