ARPANET was develped with the goal of decentrilizing the communication of important information. This is another way in which the Cold War fundamentaly impacted the development of the internet. Without the threat of war or attack would the interent have developed a central server location which acted as a communication hub for all users? In a world where the threat of attack isn't a worry, how does this affect connectivity. Are we limited by the decentralized nature of the internet or has it pushed us forward?
