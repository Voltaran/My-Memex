It seems to be that our idea of the internet and computers is largely reliant on our limited understanding of its possibilliites. Our assumptions of what the internet could be are always based on what has been. We focused on simulation in computing because of a need to test for apocolyptic furures. We cultivated the internet to be more of a stream of linear logic that focuses on the publisher and their voice instead of the voices and ideas of the readers. The internet continues to develop and strive towards furthering these goals without questioning if these goals are worth pursuing. It seems to be there is much value in completing dismantling our ideas of what the digital world could be and innovate upon our base assumptions instead of just trying to inch forward on the things we have already achiehved. Bush's Memex is one of the ideas that was concieved early on in the discussion of connectivity, however this idea seems to have been disregarded. What other ideas relating to the internet and computing were pruned to allow for the growth of what we have today?
