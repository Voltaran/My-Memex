### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article discusses the impact that the modem played in creating the social media spaces we have today. The article describes how the modem was a tool used by hobbiests in the 1980"s to send computer signals over telephone lines thereby allowing communication between computers over the phone. This early form of digital communication evolved in to Bulletin Board Systems or BBSs that became public forums for file sharing, messaging, and playing games. The social expansion of the BBS occured when teenagers were introduced to the idea and began to create BBSs to fit their needs. 

In the Mid 1990's when the World Wide Web began to gain  traction and media attention, BBSs fell to wayside and acted as scapegoats for moral panics around issues like cyberporn. Many of the BBS hosts quietly transitioned into the Internet service providers as a way to avoid any backlash. The Modem and the abillity for micro computers owned by ordinary people to talk to each other is one of the driving influences in the creation of the internet outside of what is traditionally discussed about ARPANET and the US Military.
