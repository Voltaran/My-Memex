### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article was writtern in 1945 by a Scientist known as Dr. Vannevar Bush. In this, Bush describes what he beleives the greatest pursuit of scinece to be, which is the improivemtn of recording and accessing kniowledge. He describes many innovations of instant ways to record the observations of ones environemnt through micro cameras attached to lens over the eye and machines you can speak to that will automatically dictate for you, freeing you from the confines of vour desk. However, he brings all of this together in his idea of the memex. This is an innovation to the indexing capabilites of libraries of his time. Instead of sorting each book by its section or author he would desire a natural way of sorting information based on the associations each text has to another. 

His memex is a desk that projects texts that can be linked todether to form trails of assoiciation, sorting the texts into a new style of encyclopedia that can revewal the direction of your thoughts and inform you on ways you can take your thoughts in the future. He believes this to be what is of the most importance in a time of peac e when science is freed from the schackles of weaponry.
