### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article gives a much more personal account of the use of BBSs back in the 1990's through the lens of an 11 year old getting hooked on the concept and creating their own. The retelling of the authors past with BBSs is really able to communicate the social potential that BBSs had and how much modern social media platforms reflect them today. The author describes makingr friends, getting hacked and meeting mentors all throughout his story showing how many connections an individual was able to make through the internet even in its infancy.
