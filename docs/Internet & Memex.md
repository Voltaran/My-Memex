The Memex as discused Bush shares some similarities with the structure of the internet we have today. While the association is perhaps not yet acheived, the ways in which we have been able to condence information far beyond what he was able to concieve, is of note. We have been able to not only codnence a group of texts and communications of our own selection, but we have essentially digitized all media and allowed for nearly instant access from anywhere in the world so long as we have a connection and a smartphone. I wonder what would change of Bush's idea of the memex if it was divorced from the idea of the desk. Would he be proud or dissapointed in the internet we have today?
