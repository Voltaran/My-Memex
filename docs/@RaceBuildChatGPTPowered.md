### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article discusses the new AI Product known as Chat GPT and how it could possibly influence search engines. Many people have asked CHATGPT questions about information and received satisfying answers. This has prompted the discussion around potentially integrating the technology with search engines for a more natural and helpful experience looking up information. However, this article discusses how there are still some issues in the technology. Most of the issues come up with the fact that GPT still does not know what it is saying, and only predicts text based off of its training. A feature that could trusted to accurately retrieve information in such a way would need to know what it was saying so that it could not make the mistake of providing falsified or even hallucinated answers. Another implication that came up was that of marketing. It would be necessary to completely alter marketing on search engines if AI were integrated fully in to the experience.
