What is the most powerful thing I learned in this course? There was a lot that I learned through the process of taking this course. Most interestingly, I really do think the answer to this question is going to be different for everyone. The nature of this course is set up in such a way that our learning was actually guided by our own interest and so this wasn't a hard thing to understand. The most powerful thing I learnt, or the most important thing I learnt are the things that stick out in my brain the most when I think of the readings I've done while compiling my memex. I believe the most powerful thing I've learned can be summarized through the journey from [@mikecaulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015 (M2)](@mikecaulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015%20(M2).md) to [@publisher11EvolutionInternet2016 (M2)](@publisher11EvolutionInternet2016%20(M2).md). I did not know when writing my memex that these notes would end up connecting but it makes perfect sense. The first article discusses what the internet could have been, while the last actually discusses what it is and how it got there. The notes that connect these ideas are my ruminations on the different events that contributed to the culture and structure of the internet we are used to today, asking the question of what the internet —and by extension our society—  would look like today if we had zigged instead of zagged. These questions are always the most interesting to me because we tend to take for granted thee things around us because they are normal, but there exists the possibility of a world where the internet formed in a completely different way and to the people living there, our internet and society as a whole may look completely alien to them. I will take you through each of these articles and explain why I believe they are some of the most powerful pieces of information I gathered from this course.

Starting with [[@mikecaulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015 (M2)]] 

My entry on this article gives an apt description of my main takeaways from the piece. What makes this article stand out to me is that it was the first time I was able to understand some of the concepts we had been talking about on a deeper level. The analogy of the garden vs the stream really helped me understand the idea of the memex discussed in [[@bushWeMayThink1945]]. The idea that one’s path through the internet is just as valuable as the stops along the way didn’t make sense until explained in this way. I think the value of this article and its importance lies mostly with that analogy, and the discussion on what an internet developed with the garden in mind may have looked like. This is a powerful thought because it challenges the way we think about the internet and doesn’t accept the way it is now as the way it should be.

This brings me to the next path on this journey [[Garden vs Stream (M2)]] 

Having read Bush and Caulfield and having these ideas of a more interconnected internet that users can experience non-linearly I wanted to ask if this was really a better alternative or is it a case of the grass being greener on someone else’s lawn. We have developed alongside the internet we have today and the way it functions. We have had the opportunity to fully experience it and draw up important criticisms that may point to better alternatives, but harkening back to the world of possibilities, I ask if there would be something lost had the internet developed in a way similar to Bush’s dreams? I believe we should not only challenge the structures that exist in our society but also the ideas we have about them. Is there some benefit from the way the internet developed today, would everything automatically better if we could make these changes?

Next we’ll look at [[Pruned Possibillities (M2)]] 

This idea note encapsulates the essence of the journey through looking at the history of the internet and the ideas that were abandoned to allow for the ones we are familiar with to grow. This bridges the gap from the conceptualizations of the internet to the real history of how it developed. Building off my notes made from the lecture on the cold war and from Caulfield, while only being the 3rd not in the chain, it really is at the center of the journey as it dives into what I think the most powerful thing I learned was. The fact that our present is the result of a series of choices to let one branch grow, while we chop off the others. That a deterministic view of what the internet and online culture has become is not accurate or helpful in blazing our way forward.

Next is [[Without the the influence of the Cold War (M2)]] 

This note brings a focus from the last note towards the effect the war had on the internet and technologies born from it. An internet developed in a time of peace might not have focused on simulation so heavily, which may have had a huge impact on gaming. Another one of the ways in which these readings have challenged me to not accept the one path hostory decided to take and ask what could have been.

This leads into the lecture on the cold war[[@westernuniversityHowColdWar2014 (M2)]]. 

My notes summarize my key takeaways, but what it does not capture is how interesting I think it is that something as modern as the internet was influenced so heavily by events that took place nearly 60 years ago. I never knew before this lecture how influential the cold war was on modern technology today. It represents a specific nexus point in our history. A time of intrigue and fear of war during a time of leaps and bounds being made in technological innovation happened at the perfect time to create the exact circumstances necessary to give rise to modern internet culture today.

[[War driving innovation (M2)]]

This note takes a more narrow focus at asking big questions. Instead of asking want could be, I instead of ask if its even possible for the internet to exist without the threat of war. The internet was created for the specific purpose of creating a decentralized network that allowed for the quick transmission of information between computers, but if we weren’t worries about foreign sabotage would we have even cared?

This brings us to the end of our journey at the [[@publisher11EvolutionInternet2016 (M2)]] 

Like the other summaries, my takeaways from this article are already recorded. The significance of this article, I think, lies most in its path along this journey. Here we have an article that discusses our specific branch, the way history just happened to go and we see this article situated at the end of a chain where we have discussed all the different things that made that specific branch possible and all the different branches that could have been. It puts into perspective the entire point of this journey, the powerful information I learned from this course. That we should not just accept reality as it is. Each cause has an effect that causes another effect. Understanding that I have the freedom to reject the status quo and ask about what other possibilities may exist is definitely one of the most powerful things I learned from this course. This article sits like a cherry on the top of a sundae and I think that it is the perfect way to end this journey.
