The comparrison between Dewey working hard to find a way standardize the way books are sorted and Bush suggesting that the best way forward is to personalize the way each person sorts their information is very interesting. Bush's idea seems to counteract the critisims of a lack of plurality in the DDC as each persons unique sorting system can be accessed and utilized.
