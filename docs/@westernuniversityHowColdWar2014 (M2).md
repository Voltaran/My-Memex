### Summary & Key Take Aways

This lecture discusses the impact that the cold war had on computer technology and the eventual evolution of video games. The lecturer discusses more than the fact that computers were made during the cold war, he claims that computers and the cold war are intrinsically linked, and each was shaped by the other. The mentality, the way of thinking, the needs and desires of the American military during the cold war are a fundamental part of the way computers were built. When the threat of atomic war was on the rise, it became quickly apparent that no experience could prepare anyone for this threat. As such, lead thinkers in the military saw fit to attempt to simulate warfare. This was originally done with dice and figures on hex grids. Ultimately this would end up being the inspiration for a wargames like D&D or Warcraft and the like. Ultimately the development of computers and simulation grew from this desire to simulate war conditions in real time. Many computer and analog simulation hybrids were developed in this time as the technology slowly developed. In another area of evolution towards modern computers was the creation of SAGE a computer designed to predict and intercept incoming planes and bombers with guided missiles. Despite the fact that this technology became largely obsolete as ICBMs became the new big threat to the country and this system couldn’t keep up, it does not mean that it did contribute largely to modern computers. The integration of visual displays, keyboards, networks, and sending information over telephone lines was all brought together in SAGE. Even when the project was scrapped, many of the parts were used as prompts for sci-fi productions in Hollywood which ultimately shaped the nations perceptions of computers culturally.

The real leap forward came from the creation of the first video game, Space War. Developed by an MIT student with a new Minicomputer, the game borrowed the concepts of simulation and the established technology from sage and combined them together to get a simulated battle between to spaceships fighting one another. This game acts as a culmination of all the mentalities developed in the cold war, simulating in real time and in particular, simulating advanced warfare. This game would not have been possible if the ideas of simulation had not been established during the cold war, and going forward all games seem to reflect this same basic desire. The lecturer asks the question in his discussion of what the world could have looked like had our goals been different if computers hadn’t developed in this time. We have these assumptions on what computers can do, but only because we have created them for this purpose specifically. His lecture serves as a challenge to our definitions and the boundaries that have been traced around computing as well as an interesting progression of technology as it has been influenced by real world events.
