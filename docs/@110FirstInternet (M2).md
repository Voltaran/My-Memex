### Summary & Key Take Aways

This video details the important first log that recorded the first ever use of the ARPANET. This document serves as a birth record for the modern internet, the first steps taken by man into a digital age from which we would never return. Charles S. Kline’s report is much like the first words of Neil Armstrong as he strides upon the moon. While this log may seem insignificant compared to other relics of the internet's past, the fact that we have records of its first use seems to be a very important part of our history considering how much this invention has fundamentally altered the way we live.
