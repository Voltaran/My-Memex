The article accurately predicts that one of the largest impacts of the expanding network is how we as a society socially adapted to this technology. While it was not explicitly discussed in the article, this is extremeley relevent to the social industry that was produced with the expanding of the interent. The creation of facebook and other large social media platforms demonstrates how the act of socializing fundamentally changed with the expanding of the internet. Social circles got exponentially larger when distance no longer became a factor of who you could interact with. The social network seems to fall in line with the fundamental shift discussed by the author, and the adaptations in the from of online dating, zoom meetings, and other online forms of interaction are examples of how society has changed in consequence to the growth of the internet

-   How does this idea fit into what I already know?
-   What does this idea mean for some other idea that I already have?
-   Does this add to, contradict, or explain another idea that I already have?

You link to other notes by putting them in square brackets. Remember that Obsidian will auto search as you type for notes with those words. Once you've selected a note, you can add the ^ symbol to link to a subheading or block within a note, too.}
