Bush suggests that in creating a memex and allowing for you to create a trail of association, these trails themselves could be made accessible for any who may need to follow said trail. When using google, suggestred searches and the most popular results will come up first. Is this some form of following the trails fo your peers? You present a query and google will autofill with things other people have searched and will suggest the webistes they have used. Additionally, Google will present you with similar questions that have been asked after that search and present the user with the webistes used to answer those questions. While not as comprehensive as the memex, it seems like search enignes are itilizing some forms of association for leading users down similar trails as their peers.
