### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article tracks the evolution of the internet from the early dies of ARPANET to the social media platforms widely used today. This article plays particular attention to the protocols of communication developed in the early days of the internet and how these protocols have influenced the internet and its growth. A protocol is simply a rule that is followed in how computers can communicate with one another. An example of a protocol  that we all use is  “hello” and “goodbye” to begin and end phone calls. Computers will utilize protocols similarly to communicate with one another. In addition to the use of protocols, the article discusses the decentralized nature of the internet and how it was developed with the goal of not being reliant upon a central hub that enabled communication in the event of sabotage. This meant that the internet was designed to be a network of many nodes that all communicated with one another and could therefore not be destroyed in its entirety in any centralized attack. The article discusses how ISP’s acted as hosts for users to connect their individual computers. Packet switching protocols were developed to group messages into packages that could be sent and decoded in groups to allow for faster transmission. The development of the email address, hyperlink text interpretation, and the eventual creation of web 1.0 were all reliant upon the ideas of decentralization and protocols. With the development of personal computers and the dial up modem, now anyone able to utilize these protocols to connect to the internet could communicate with people through their ISPS all over the word. Communication was revolutionized, internet industries began to rise through the creation of websites, and the new culture of the internet began to form thought the first social media sites like AOL that utilized these features to house chat rooms and instant messaging between users.
