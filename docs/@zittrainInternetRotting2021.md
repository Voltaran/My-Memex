### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article discusses a phenomenon known as the “Rot of the Internet”. This name describes the process through which our inattentiveness towards preserving the validity and access of information of the internet is causing a mass net loss of information as time progresses. The author compares the internet archives of information to libraries where great precautions have been taken to safeguard the physical copies of books against the wear of time, tampering, or disaster. This has always been a practice in human history as a way to preserve knowledge. We would have expert precautionary measures and expert facilitators in charge of keeping the knowledge. However, when it came to digitizing our information, no such procedures or experts were involved in safeguarding it. The article documents link decay and link drift where links in older articles pointing to other sources no longer exist or have different information. They found that nearly half of all New York Times articles holding deep links had decayed/ This means anyone looking back to those articles and wanting to follow those links for context clues will be unable to do so and the precious information has been lost. The author also warns about how easy it is to alter information once it is put on the internet. Companies like Amazon’s Kindle have access to all E-books stored on the devices and it is possible to remove or alter the text of these e-books at anytime. This is an unprecedented power that can be held that has never been held before and we are simply allowing it to happen without safeguard. The author warns that unless we develop safeguards against these measures, we risk losing the large wealth of information we have accumulated on the internet.
