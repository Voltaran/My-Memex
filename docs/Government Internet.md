 The article discusses early on that the internet developed in a way that was backed by the state as such unlike a library there were no staff or procedures put towards regulating the safeguarding of information. Would a state-backed internet be a preferrable option? We all value the internet for its freedom, but clearly a lot of negatives have come from the use of the internet that potentially could not have been possible if more structure were in place during its development. Is out total freedom on the internet worth the cost of harm?
