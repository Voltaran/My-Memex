### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article asks the question of what the internet will look like in another 50 years and gathers information from many experts on the internet and produces their explanations. The largest opinion of experts is that the Internet and reality will cease to be separate places. Another 50 years is likely to have a full integration of the internet into the real world. No more will the web be limited to the screen. Experts predict that we will all be wearing visual and audio implants that allow us to interact with the web in real time. It will be fully integrated into who or what we see. They predict access to live translation opening up communication for the world, increased biodata allowing us to better understand our health and dispatch medical services. Increased information access where searching largely turns mor conversational. With these positives however there will also be sacrifices. Our privacy will be greatly decreased as we give companies more access to our data in trade of convenience. The face of advertising will completely change as we will no longer need to be pushed towards products, instead leaving our shopping to assistants like Siri or Alexa. In addition to privacy there also likely be sacrifices made in open-source information as the companies involved in the new technology may have the ability to control the information you have access to. Ultimately, the author discusses how this will be a turning point in our growth as a society and all we can do until then is try to mitigate any damage that may occur by safeguarding any possible negative eventualities now.
