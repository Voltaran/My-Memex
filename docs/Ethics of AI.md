Having used many different versions of generative AI, I can say that I have greatly enjoyed the process. It has removed a barrier in effort and skill when looking for custom images or ideas online. While I understand the concern of large data scraping and people having there data stolen. I still question whether the use of these images for training is legally distinct enough from a real person training themselves on publicly available data.
