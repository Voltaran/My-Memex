The lecture on the cold war and video games as well as the other articles discussing ARPANET have all touched on the importance of the Cold War in the internet's development. War is known to drive innovation. When nations are competing to survive against each other scientific advancments are rapid. Is the internet simply born from this phenomenon, or were their pther factors pushing is towards this creation? Can the internet only exist if humanity is fighting to survive and protect the flow of information, or would we eventually come to this development from other mtoviators?
