### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article discusses the use of a personal wiki to organize ideas as a way to use the internet and guide ones thinking. The discussion focuses largely on the ideas of the garden and the stream. Both of these terms have a history in 20th century internet discussions but they are given adjusted meaning in this context. The garden refers to the idea that web exists as a space, non sequential or linear space that is relational and subjective. The garden can be seen from many angles and new paths can be created each time we pass through. The garden is a collection of experiences. Each flower, tree, bridge is meant to contribute to that experience, but one need not experience them in the same order or look at them at all. The garden encourages the creation of new paths and new perspectives. The stream refers to a sequential ordered experience that we are at the center of. We move through the stream in the direction it is flowing. We follow the force of information and experience it in a linear fashion. The stream refers to the context of the argument, how one comment exists a response to another, as a response to another, as a response to another. We learn the context of the information by following the streams and becoming familiar with each unique stream.

The author discusses the As We May Think article and how the memex uses the text of the garden. A unique experience that each reader has as they navigate through the information, they create their own paths with links, summaries, and annotations, recording their own perspectives and contributing to the garden. The author discusses how this potential hasnâ€™t been explored in the modern internet. The internet today does not lend itself to a garden structure, readers can not easily make public their connections and annotations. The power is in the writers. As such, each person who desires to add to the knowledge of the internet must become their own publisher, they must contribute to a conversation and assert their information, they follow the stream instead. The author asserts that the way forward in growing is to implement features and encourage the growth of garden tools as opposed to the stream so that we may improve our ability to use the internet for learning.
