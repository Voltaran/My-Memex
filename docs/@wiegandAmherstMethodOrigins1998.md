### Summary & Key Take Aways


This article discusses the creation of the dewey decimal system and looks for the influences Melvile Dewey had when creating the system. The article discusses the authors and philosophers that he likely pulled inspiration from, as well as faculty members from Amherst College where he got his educuation. This is where most critism in the article comes from as Amherst college was known at the time for reproducing a very objective worldview in its students centered on Anglo-saxon tradition. This ultimately influcned the Dewey decimal system in the classification and hierarchy of topics of study.
