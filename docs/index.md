This Memex largely explores the technical advancements  of the internet and computing with a particular focus on how these advancements have influenced the culture of the time. Each new step step forward on the path we've taken means there is a path untraveled elsewhere. Many of my thoughts here will often ponder upon the ways the internets development has been influenced and ask how it could be different if those influences have been changed. What would our socity look like today if the internet was fundamewntally different from how we understood it now?
