### Summary & Key Take Aways

This article discusses the impact of the first laying of the Atlantic submarine cable that connected Europe to North America. The author discusses telegraphy’s impact on Imperialism as faster communications allowed for Britain to exert greater control over colonies and jurisdictions that were previously out of their reach and influence. It also details the compression of time and space as communications now moved faster than goods in most areas which helped to develop the concept of future trading and the stock market. The article is very critical of the idea that this cable acted as a Victorian internet as telegraphy and the internet are very different in their ability to create connectivity among the people. The high cost of using these transmissions barred 99% of the public from benefitting from it and as such, only a small elite portion of the population could truly be called connected. Many point to this event as the birth of globalization, however the author is critical of the idea as the cable was simply a contributor to the already growing efforts of globalization of the time.
