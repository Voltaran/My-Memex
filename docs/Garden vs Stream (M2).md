What would an internet guided by principles of gardeninig resemble? The authro states that the garden more closely resembled the ideas discussed by Bush, but is it inhererntly better? Do we envy what we could have had simply because we we do not have it? Does the stream offer something to use that we would desire had we developed in anogther way? Certianly it can be said that the logical and linear flow of discussion is helpful in some regards. I am just wondering if this is a case of the grass being greener in someones elses lawn. What would we have lost if we had started off with tools of gardening straight from the beginning?
