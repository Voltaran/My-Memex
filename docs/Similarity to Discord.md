One thing that stood out to me the most when hearing the details of the BBSs is how much I feel like they resembled Discord servers today. Having to get invites through specific codes, moderators, themes, discussion channels and even a fair share of drama. The only major difference it seems is in how many people were able to access it at a given time.
