Communities for illicit activities on the dark web in the way they were described in this article seem very reminiscent of the ways in which people would enter BBSâ€™s in the early days of the internet. Small insular communities that require specific knowledge to enter such as passcodes or invitations. Its interesting how early on in the internets development the concepts used for creating communities that are extremely connected are now used to create communities that are fairly exclusive.
